## Welcome

Welcome to my site! My name is Progrematic, and I'm a software engineer working in the video games industry.

This site is mainly for me to write down some thoughts, post progress on my projects, and overall act as a journal for myself and those that care to read it.

If that sounds interesting, stick around!

Cheers,
Prog
